        "As the inaugural Cloud Security Engineer, led security initiatives throughout a year-and-a-half long data center migration to GCP.",
        "Implemented CIS standards across hundreds of VMs in Google Compute Engine and thousands of BigQuery datasets, ensuring compliance with encryption key usage and preventing misconfigurations such as publicly accessible ports.",
        "Spearheaded an initiative to optimize Terraform pipelines, slashing wait times due to handoffs from 2 hours to just 30 minutes, resulting in significant time savings for both approvers and requesters.",
        "Successfully implemented egress filtering for URLs in PHI environments, a pivotal step in achieving HITRUST certification. Orchestrated the deployment of DiscrimiNAT across 6 VPCs, effectively filtering traffic in 27 environments with over 900 unique FQDNs.",
        "Developed a Python Flask application empowering developers to create temporary egress firewall rules in lower environments, circumventing the 24-hour SLA for FQDN additions. This innovation saved thousands of engineering hours, allowing uninterrupted development and testing.",
        "Revived and optimized scrum practices within the security team, taking a leadership role in restarting meetings and configuring Jira boards.",
        "Introduced sprint planning, backlog grooming, and retrospective sessions, resulting in an outstanding 77% reduction in Lead Time for ticket completion, from an average of 61.3 days to just 13.8 days after 3 months."
