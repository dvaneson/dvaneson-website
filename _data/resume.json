I am passionate about learning and am always looking for ways to challenge myself. \r\n\r\nI'm interested in high-assurance software, low-level programming, and data analysis. My thesis, \"Functional Programming for Systems Software\", provides a case study of Habit, a functional language designed for low-level programming. \r\n\r\nTo see some of my projects, visit https:\/\/dvaneson.com\/projects",
