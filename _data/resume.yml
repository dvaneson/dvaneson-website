        # - Established the Cloud Security program as the inaugural Cloud Security Engineer, directing initiatives and coordinating with cross-functional teams to prioritize Cloud Security objectives.
        - As the inaugural Cloud Security Engineer, led security initiatives throughout a year-and-a-half long data center migration to GCP.
        # - Programmatically enforced CIS standards on hundreds of VMs migrated to Google Compute Engine and thousands of datasets uploaded to BigQuery.
        - Enforced CIS standards with Policy-as-Code for hundreds of GCP projects, ensuring compliance with encryption key usage and preventing misconfigurations such as publicly accessible ports.
        - Spearheaded an initiative to optimize Terraform pipelines, slashing wait times due to handoffs from 2 hours to just 30 minutes, resulting in significant time savings for both approvers and requesters.
        # - Collaborated closely with stakeholders to consolidate the approval process and automate promotions, resulting in significant time savings for both approvers and requesters.
        - Successfully implemented egress filtering for URLs in PHI environments, a pivotal step in achieving HITRUST certification. Orchestrated the deployment of DiscrimiNAT across 6 VPCs, effectively filtering traffic in 27 environments with over 900 unique FQDNs.
        - Developed a Python Flask application empowering developers to create temporary egress firewall rules in lower environments, circumventing the 24-hour SLA for FQDN additions. This innovation saved thousands of engineering hours, allowing uninterrupted development and testing.
        - Revived and optimized scrum practices within the security team, taking a leadership role in restarting meetings and configuring Jira boards.
        - Introduced sprint planning, backlog grooming, and retrospective sessions, resulting in an outstanding 77% reduction in Lead Time for ticket completion, from an average of 61.3 days to just 13.8 days after 3 months.
