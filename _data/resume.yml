    brief: >-
        I am a PSU alumni with a passion for learning, always finding new ways
        to challenge myself.
        <br><br>
        My interests include high assurance software, low level programming, and
        data analysis. My honors thesis provides a case study of Habit, a
        functional language designed for low level programming.
