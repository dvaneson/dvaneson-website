          Functional Programming for Systems Software

      summary: >
          Habit is a functional language specially designed for low-level
          programming. Habit aims to have the reliability and readability of a
          high-level language, while offering the memory management and
          efficiency of languages like C. In this thesis I provide a case study
          of Habit and discuss if it meets these goals.
      highlights:
          - Implemented a page table in C and a prototype of Habit.
          - Enabled IA-32 paging and setup system calls in x86 Assembly.
